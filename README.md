### Text-to-Speech (Tacotron1-based)

Objective: Implemented a small TTS system by adapting the Tacotron1 model (full-sentence method).  
- Studied and applied methods from the paper *Findings of EMNLP 2020 (346)*.  
- Modified and extended the original [Tacotron-pytorch implementation](https://github.com/ttaoREtw/Tacotron-pytorch).  
- Built an incremental pipeline capable of generating speech from text.
